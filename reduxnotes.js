/*
state is a memory
and its used for interaction
describing how an app should look
state management is a problem as an app becomes bigger
update n re render
redux solves state management
meaning removing all the state component from an app and store in a massive obj passing the state to whichever component needs it.
called state management.
redux is a tool used for state mngment
why redux
it goes well with react
good for managing large state
useful for sharing data  btw containers
predictable state management using the 3 principles i.e
1.single source of truth(massive object thhat describes how the app should look)
2. state is read only
3.changes using pure functions

action
reducer
store
make changes

flux pattern
 actions means being able to solve pprobblems in a logical sense
 action->Dispatcher->store->new

 installing redux
 clone the app
 cd the file
 npm install
 nm start
 npm install redux
 npm install react-redux
